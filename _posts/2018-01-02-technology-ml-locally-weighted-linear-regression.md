   When 
   
   
   Why we use least square error in cost function to fit linear regression model? 
   There always exists variance in fitting model. Variance is consistent with Gaussian error 
 distribution. When expand Gaussian error formula, we'll finally get the result that least square
 error is part of Gaussian error formula. When least square error is becoming small gradually, 
 the variance will be reduced to small meanwhile. And we'll get more precious model with small 
 variance. So we'll choose least square error in linear regression.
